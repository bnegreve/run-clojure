# run-clojure

Run aims at providing a framework to easily reproduce time experiments algorithms. 

Run is a parametrizable script that can be used to program, run and
measure various metric such as execution time and memory usage on a
large number of executions of a given program.  Run stores program
output / execution time / memory usage / exact date / machine name / binary files.
